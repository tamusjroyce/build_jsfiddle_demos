A cross-platform node tool that builds fiddle.js appropriate demo folders based on each html file found.
The html file has all <link rel=\"import\" href=\"/path/to/file.html\" /> replaced with the linked file contents.
It also does its best to combines all locally referenced css files into demo.css. And javascript files as demo.js.
It also adds a blank demo.details file if one does not exist.
